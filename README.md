 The 'MythCenterXMAS-wide' theme for MythTV
============================================

This is a Christmas version of the popular MythCenter-wide theme. It has random
backgrounds with animated snow and a festive colour scheme.

Background Images
-----------------
The backgrounds where found over a long period of time so have forgot where
most of them came from but I believe all are free to use for non commercial use.

If you recognise an image and want attribution let me know and I will add it here.
